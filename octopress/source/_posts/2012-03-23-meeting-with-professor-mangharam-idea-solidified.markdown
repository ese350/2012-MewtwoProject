Today, we met with Professor Mangharam and talked to him about some of
the ideas that we had been throwing around. Turns out, our best ideas
(or at least, the ones that could be spun into some sort of project)
were the ones that we thought of near the end of the night when we
were getting really sleepy.

So what did we decide on? Well, we initially wanted to make some sort
of device that would track form in say, sports such as tennis, running
or weightlifting. He advised us that to go with a medical focus would
make the project more likely to have people interested and mentioned
that he could get in touch with some physical therapists, potentially
making our product actually used in the market. Exciting, huh?

Another fascinating part for me was that we'd be using a Kinect as the
motion tracker. I always knew video games had lots of use. Now I have
more evidence for my mom.
