  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Abstract</h3>


<p>Patients undergoing physical therapy have to make frequent visits to
the physical therapist to obtain treatment. These therapy sessions
typically consist of patients repeating one movement and therapists
give feedback. To patients, these appointments are a nuisance and the
exercises are monotonous. Studies have shown that only 31% of people
comply as recommended. We propose to develop a game-based application
for the Kinect that would serve as a home-supplement for physical
therapy. It motivates patients to perform exercises prescribed by
their physical therapist and gives real-time feedback on the
correctness of their movements. In addition, it generates a final
report that summarizes their exercise statistics.</p>

<p>We divided the game into two parts. The first part was to use the
Kinect to determine the correctness of patientsâ€™ movements. We did
this by taking the angle measured by the Kinect and setting a
threshold on the angle individualized for the patient and the limb.We
then developed a game based an existing game <a
href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547625">Hurdle
Turtle</a>. Our version simply has a jump key, but has different level
walls corresponding to target and reach angles for the patient. We
also provide instantaneous feedback on incorrect movements and do not
validate a jump unless the movement was proper and not too fast.</p>

<p>And without further ado, here&#8217;s our demo video!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as we all know, there are usually two ways of doing things, the
easy way and the hard way. For setting up the Kinect, we erroneously
chose the hard way. Given, when you learn how to work with something
for the first time, it usually takes a while to set up. But when
you&#8217;re working with multiple things at the first time together, then
things get a lot more hectic.</p>

<p>So long story short, we found some tutorials on how to install OpenNI
for the kinect as well as various other dependencies needed to run the
Kinect hardware. These worked and gave us some pretty cool bitmaps
painted onto the screen that varied in color based on depth. Some of
the example code could even track the user and showed a few of their
joints with a little skeleton connecting them. Pretty neat
really. I&#8217;ll post some pictures next time.</p>

<p>This time, I wanted to focus on how to set up the Kinect because that
gave us a whole lot of trouble that could have taken much less
time. For one, don&#8217;t try the following on VMWare Player running an iso
of Ubuntu 11.10. That for sure didn&#8217;t work. And probably VMWare Player
in general? We had some pretty bad luck there. The following
instructions should work on any (newer?) 32-bit Ubuntu distros.</p>

<p>Install dependencies first:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev openjdk-6-jdk doxygen
</code></pre>

<p>Then install OpenNI:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git
cd OpenNI/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist
chmod a+x RedistMaker
./RedistMaker
cd ../Redist/OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x86-v1.5.2.23
sudo ./install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Next up is SensorKinect:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect.git
cd SensorKinect/Bin
tar xvf SensorKinect091-Bin-Linux32-v5.1.0.25.tar.bz2
cd Sensor-Bin-Linux-x86-v5.1.0.25/
sudo ./install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can plug in the Kinect and run <code>lsusb</code> and check for 3
Microsoft Corp entries. If you see these, you&#8217;ve succesfully installed
everything and the sample code should run on your machine! To test it
out, go to the OpenNI/Platform/Linux/Bin/x86-Release/ folder and run
any of the code in there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we met with Professor Mangharam and talked to him about some of
the ideas that we had been throwing around. Turns out, our best ideas
(or at least, the ones that could be spun into some sort of project)
were the ones that we thought of near the end of the night when we
were getting really sleepy.</p>

<p>So what did we decide on? Well, we initially wanted to make some sort
of device that would track form in say, sports such as tennis, running
or weightlifting. He advised us that to go with a medical focus would
make the project more likely to have people interested and mentioned
that he could get in touch with some physical therapists, potentially
making our product actually used in the market. Exciting, huh?</p>

<p>Another fascinating part for me was that we&#8217;d be using a Kinect as the
motion tracker. I always knew video games had lots of use. Now I have
more evidence for my mom.</p>
